# splTextEditor

This is a very simple text editor.A basic text editor has some functions like write plain text,save them in a file,copy files,copy lines,paste,create tables ,change font sizes,change font colours,change font types(italic or bold).
But it is a very raw text editor project so there is no ui.It shows everything in terminal. but when we have to work with the fonts we can not do it in the terminal.To solve this problem I have used html files so that I can manipulate my desired part from a file and using html i can change it and show the change using browser.
